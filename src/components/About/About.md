### About leveler

The leveler database was created to help out my friends in the creative community and service industry who are currently being hit hard by COVID health and safety restrictions (venue closures/tour cancellations/shifts lost/commissions canceled/etc and so on).

#### The functions of the site
1. It hosts the database of freelancers impacted, along with their venmo/paypal direct payment links
2. It hosts a mechanism allowing our friends with salaried positions and/or who are not at immediate risk of losing their jobs to distribute a small portion of wealth in an **egalitarian format**. Think: peer-to-peer emergency relief stimulus.

**No money passes through the site. The site is not a business.** It is meant to be a **tool** to connect people who **can** help with people who **need** help. I’ve set guidelines in place as a suggestion, which you should read below.

#### The goal
If our freelancing/gig economy friends can be in a position to receive a critical mass of micro-distributions, then it will start to add up. The database will keep cycling through itself indefinitely, so the cadence of payments you see will likely ebb and flow until it gets a steady traction. **THEREFORE, please share this far and wide. **

#### I'm in! I want to distribute!
If you are a salaried human or don’t feel like you’re at risk of losing your job this week or next, this site has made it relatively easy for you to distribute a small portion of your wealth to our friends in the gig economy while we all make it through this extremely weird moment. 

This process will take a few minutes and MUST BE DONE FROM YOUR PHONE.  You can not make venmo payments outside of the mobile app!!!!!

1. Click "Distribute" to be assigned a group of 5 people.
2. Venmo, Paypal each of them via their payment link. 
3. When you're done with each person, check the box that says 'I Contributed'.
3. We strongly suggest sending the same amount to each person (ie: 5.00 x 10 = 50.00 total).
4. If you wish to distribute an amount larger than 100 dollars, we suggest you repeat steps 1 and 2 until you are satisfied with the amount that you have distributed.


#### Suggested Guidelines for those who wish to be listed in the database
The leveler database is made up of freelancers/gig economy/service industry workers whose jobs are getting canceled, along with their payment information. People who add themselves to the database should understand that they are putting their venmo/paypal/payment link into a database that will be surfaced online. 
1. If you reach your minimum needed amount, please consider removing yourself from the database by emailing an admin: [leveler.info@gmail.com](mailto:leveler.info@gmail.com)
2. This is self-governed and self-policed. Please look out for each other and people you know. Do not add yourself twice. If you add yourself twice you will be removed.
3. If your needs have been met based on the amount of money you lost due to already booked job cancellations, we highly suggest distributing excess funds back to your peers through the database.
