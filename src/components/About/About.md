### About leveler

Leveler is a community platform that facilitates donations from people who have job security or funds to distribute to people who need it.

### How it works: 

**Recipients** who need funds can apply with their venmo/paypal direct payment links by clicking “receive”.

**Distributors** can donate funds to up to five individuals at a time, by clicking “distribute” and then completing payment to the five individual recipients they have been assigned. Recipients are pulled by geographic region based on the IP address of the distributor. If you are distributing funds using a VPN, you will be directed to individuals in your VPN’s locale.

**Resources** are community-run and available publicly. Recipients, distributors and anyone interested can contribute helpful links, comments or discussion to our community by clicking “resources”.

**Micro-communities** are offshoots of the leveler database that contain only recipients from a specific community or that share a specific need. If you want to create a leveler database specific to your cause or community, contact us: leveler.info@gmail.com

### Guiding Principles

**From each according to their ability, to each according to their needs.** Leveler is a not for profit venture. It will be used only as a tool to connect people who can help with people who need help. All transactions happen directly between donors and recipients.

**Resources will be shared freely.** Even if you are not in a position to receive or distribute, through our resources page, anyone can add to the conversation. Our resources page is a place to strategize, organize and connect with other mutual aid efforts and funding opportunities.

**Our community is built on trust.** If you are a recipient and have received what you need, we ask that you remove yourself from the database by emailing remove@leveler.info. If you have received more than what you need, please consider distributing funds back to other recipients by visiting http://leveler.info and clicking “distribute”.

**We can bail each other out.** We have a shared responsibility toward one another. By being part of leveler’s database, you are connected to people in your community who are also in a position to receive assistance. When you share leveler among your peers who are in salaried or financially stable positions, you are helping the entire community receive funding.

**Please remember, this relief effort is an experiment in self-organized mutual aid, and while we think peer-to-peer mutual aid is something that can and should work, leveler should not be relied upon as a meaningful source of income.**

### I'm in! I want to distribute!

If you have funds to spare, this site has made it relatively easy for you to distribute a small portion of those funds to people who need it.
 
This process will take a few minutes and works best from a mobile device. (You can not make venmo payments on your computer).


1. Click "Distribute" to be assigned a group of 5 people.

2. Venmo, Paypal each of them via their payment link.

3. When you're done with each person, check the box that says 'I Contributed'.

4. We strongly suggest sending the same amount to each person (ie: 5.00 x 10 = 50.00 total).

5. If you wish to distribute an amount larger than 100 dollars, we suggest you repeat steps 1 and 2 until you are satisfied with the amount that you have distributed.

### Guidelines for recipients:

People who add themselves to the database acknowledge that they are putting their venmo/paypal/payment link into a database that will be surfaced online. This means anyone can see it. We will always keep your email address private.

1. If you find that you no longer need to be listed as a recipient on leveler, please consider removing yourself from the database by emailing an admin: remove@leveler.info

2. This is self-governed and self-policed. Please look out for each other and people you know. Do not add yourself twice. If you add yourself twice you will be removed.

3. If your needs have been met based on the amount of money you lost due to already booked job cancellations, we highly suggest distributing excess funds back to your peers through the database.
